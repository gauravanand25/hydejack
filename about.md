I will be joining the Masters program at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst in Fall 2017.

I am interested in Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. Apart from that I thoroughly enjoy learning and reading about Physics, Cognitive Neuroscience, Economics (typically Game Theory).
