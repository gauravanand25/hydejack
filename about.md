I will be joining the Masters program at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst in Fall 2017. I graduated from University of Delhi (Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2015.

I am interested in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. Apart from that I thoroughly enjoy exploring and reading about Physics (Theoritical and Quantum), Cognitive Neuroscience, Economics and Philosophy (Vivekanada's interpretation of Advaita).

I have been working at Adobe, India mainly on Aesthetic Layout Suggestions for Documents i.e. suggesting design ideas by modifying layout, font and color. I have worked at an agile startup [Codenation] a subsidiary of [Trilogy] in the space of Source Code Quality Analysis.
