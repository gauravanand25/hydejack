I am a CS grad student pursuing Masters at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst since Fall 2017. I graduated from University of Delhi (Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2015.

I am interested in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Applied Mathematics. Apart from that I thoroughly enjoy exploring and reading about Physics (Theoritical and Quantum), Neuroscience (Cognitive and Behavioral), Economics (mainly Game Theory) and Philosophy (Vivekanada's interpretation of Advaita).

I have been working at Adobe, India mainly on Aesthetic Layout Recommendation for Documents i.e. suggesting design ideas for the document by improving layout, font and color. I previously worked at an agile startup [Codenation] a subsidiary of [Trilogy] making tools that analyze and help improve source-code quality.
