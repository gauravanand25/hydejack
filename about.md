I am a CS grad student pursuing Masters at the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst since Fall 2017. I graduated from University of Delhi (Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology) with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2015.

I am interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Applied Mathematics. Apart from that I thoroughly enjoy exploring and reading about Physics, Economics (mainly Game Theory) and Philosophy (Vivekanada's interpretation of Advaita).
